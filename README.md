## 🚀 About Me

I am a final-year Computer Science student focused on building **scalable backend systems, REST APIs, and database-driven applications**.

I primarily work with **Django, Django REST Framework, React**, and have hands-on experience with **SQL databases, API integration, authentication systems, and modular project architecture**.

I enjoy working on structured projects that follow clean code practices and real-world backend design patterns.
